# HTML Camera and Geolocation

_"Why do you use mobile native applications instead of simple HTML?"_ I asked [oriol](https://github.com/orioli) while chatting about his new project, [qualnotes project](https://qualnotes.com/).

I'm prety ignorant on all the involved subjects (i.e. mobile apps and frameworkds, camera and video APIs, geolocation API to name a few), but it turns out is actually possible and quite easy. Check out the simple [index.html](https://github.com/marcmagransdeabril/html_camera_and_geolocation/blob/main/index.html).
